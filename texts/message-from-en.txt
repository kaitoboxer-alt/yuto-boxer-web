《To Everyone from YUTO》

Thank you so much for visiting "Boys Boxing & Pro-Wrestling via YUTO" (Please don't tease me about the title being too long and slightly "chuuni" / edgy!).
To be completely honest about my personal tastes, I absolutely love the sight of boys in that transitional phase from high schoolers to young adults fighting it out as boxers and pro-wrestlers. That's exactly why I created this site.

However, the only thing I can do myself is write text.
That's when Generative AI appeared.

Generative AI is evolving rapidly. Of course, I understand that some people may feel uneasy or have differing opinions about it. But thanks to this technology, I was finally able to build my own ideal world.
I’ve detailed my specific policies in the menu next to this one, but I want to explain my personal intentions here.

1. What I ask the Generative AI to do:
Generate illustrations and videos of boys boxing and wrestling that would normally be impossible to see in reality.
Help build this website (though I handle the basic structure).
Translate my Japanese text into foreign languages.
Consult on finding free services for building the site (excluding the custom domain).
Help create a tool to convert the novels I write into PDF format.

2. How I will use AI moving forward:
Generating images and videos.
Fixing bugs or errors on the website.
Foreign language translation.
(Note: Currently, I am using three officially released AIs: Google Gemini, ChatGPT, and Microsoft Copilot.)

3. My Personal Policy (Yuto's Rules):
Fundamentally, I will focus entirely on writing novels and short stories myself. I will NOT use AI for writing the main text of my stories.
The only exception to the above is when I need help expressing specific dialects (like Kansai dialect) or foreign languages in the story.
All works using Generative AI will be distributed completely for free (I never intended to use them for commercial purposes).
I fully permit my AI-generated illustrations/videos and my self-written novels to be used for AI machine learning.

I apologize for the stiff explanation!
So, to sum it up: Boy's boxing, underground boxing, and pro-wrestling. And of course (why do I say "of course"? lol), there will be sexual contact and intimate scenes as well.
Calling all fans who love this kind of stuff! It’s hard to express these specific tastes out in the open, isn't it?

So, let's all get hyped and enjoy the world of boy's boxing and pro-wrestling together!
