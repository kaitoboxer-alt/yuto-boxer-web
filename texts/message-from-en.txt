Message from Yuto
Thank you so much for visiting "Boys Boxing & Pro-Wrestling via YUTO". To be completely honest, I absolutely love the sight of boys in that transitional phase from high schoolers to young adults fighting it out as boxers and pro-wrestlers. That's exactly why I created this site.

However, the only thing I can do myself is write text. That's when Generative AI appeared. While some may feel uneasy about this technology, it allowed me to finally build my ideal world.

1. What I ask the AI to do:
- Generate illustrations and videos of boys boxing and wrestling.
- Help build this website (I handle the basic structure).
- Translate text into foreign languages.
- Consult on using free web services.
- Help create a tool to convert my novels into PDF format.
- I will NOT intentionally create content based on existing characters or real people.
- AI is difficult to control for minute details, so I cannot take personal requests.

2. Future AI Use:
- Generating images and videos, fixing bugs, and translation. (Using Gemini, ChatGPT, and Copilot).

3. My Policy:
- I focus entirely on writing my own stories without AI (except for dialects or translations).
- All AI-related works are distributed for free (non-commercial).
- I permit AI machine learning of my generated images, videos, and self-written novels.

Calling all fans of boy's boxing and pro-wrestling! Let's get hyped together!
